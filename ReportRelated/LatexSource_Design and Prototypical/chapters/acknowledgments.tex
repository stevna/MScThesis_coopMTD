\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank my two supervisors, Jan von der Assen and Dr. Alberto Huertas Celdr√°n. They have helped me with all kinds of problems, given much appreciated input when it was not clear how to proceed, and provided great feedback overall. All of this has contributed greatly to the quality of this thesis and also helped me going through the more difficult times while writing the thesis.
